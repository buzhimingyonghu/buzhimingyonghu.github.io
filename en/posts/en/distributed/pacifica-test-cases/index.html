<p>Large-scale distributed storage systems have gained attention due to increasing data volumes, with replication mechanisms being key to achieving high availability and throughput. While consensus research has laid foundations for replication protocols, architectural design and engineering implementation remain challenging. This article shares experiences in designing replication mechanisms for log-based storage systems using the PacificA protocol, proposing a simple, practical, strongly consistent general replication framework that demonstrates flexibility in supporting various design choices.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="1-pacifica-process">1. PacificA Process</h1>
<p>The system implements data replication through a primary-backup model, where each data set is managed by a replica group with a designated primary server and remaining backup servers. Configuration changes are tracked by version numbers. This article focuses on strong consistency replication protocols, ensuring distributed system behavior matches single-machine consistency (linearizability).</p>
<h2 id="11-primary-backup-replication">1.1 Primary-Backup Replication</h2>
<p>Client requests are categorized into two types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Query requests for reading data</li>
<li>Update requests for writing data</li>
</ol>
<p>Strong consistency can be achieved if all servers in the replica group process the same set of requests in the same order (assuming updates are deterministic). Therefore, the primary server assigns consecutive and monotonically increasing sequence numbers to updates and directs all backup servers to process requests in this order.</p>
<h3 id="normal-operation-process">Normal Operation Process:</h3>
<h4 id="query-request-handling">Query Request Handling:</h4>
<ul>
<li>When the primary server receives a read request, it directly processes it using the state recorded in the current commit list. Query requests don&rsquo;t affect data consistency, so the primary can return results immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="write-request-handling">Write Request Handling:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The primary server assigns an incremental global sequence number to write requests, ensuring all requests are processed in a fixed order.</li>
<li>The primary sends a <code>prepare</code> message containing configuration version, sequence number, and CommittedID to all backup servers.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="backup-server-processing">Backup Server Processing:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Each backup server adds requests to its prepare list in sequence number order upon receiving <code>prepare</code> messages, marking requests as &ldquo;prepared&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The backup then sends a <code>prepared</code> message to the primary as confirmation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="state-machine-commitment">State Machine Commitment:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The primary marks a request as committed only after receiving confirmations from all backup servers. The primary then updates its commit point to the highest committed sequence number.</li>
<li>The primary returns an acknowledgment to the client indicating successful request completion.</li>
<li>With each <code>prepare</code> message, the primary includes the current commit point sequence number, informing backup servers which requests are committed. This allows backup servers to advance their commit points in sync with the primary.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="consistency-guarantees">Consistency Guarantees:</h3>
<p>The primary only adds requests to the commit list after all backups have added them to their prepare lists, ensuring commit list consistency with backup prepare lists. Backups only consider requests committed after the primary marks them as such, ensuring backup commit lists remain within the primary&rsquo;s commit range.</p>
<h3 id="commit-invariant">Commit Invariant:</h3>
<p>Forms the &ldquo;Commit Invariant&rdquo;: for primary <code>p</code> and any backup <code>q</code>, always maintains:</p>
<p>committedq ⊆ committedp ⊆ preparedq</p>
<p>This ensures data consistency and synchronization between primary and backups.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="12-configuration-management">1.2 Configuration Management</h2>
<h3 id="design-a-global-configuration-manager">Design a Global Configuration Manager:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Responsible for managing and maintaining configuration for all replica groups in the system.</li>
<li>For each replica group, the configuration manager saves the current configuration and configuration version.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="global-configuration-manager-functions">Global Configuration Manager Functions:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Reconfiguration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detects if any replica is faulty and decides whether to remove the replica or restart the replica configuration.</li>
<li>Adds new replicas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adding Backup Nodes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decides whether to add new configuration based on the set rules.</li>
<li>Configuration rules: Whether version matches, checks if the <code>committedID</code> of the replica matches (whether exists, whether less than the primary&rsquo;s <code>committedID</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary Crash, Reconfiguration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a network partition occurs, causing the primary server to be disconnected from the replicas, there may be conflicting reconfiguration requests. For example, the primary server may want to remove some replicas, while some replicas may want to remove the primary server.</li>
<li>Still first checks whether the match rule <code>L</code> is successful, and the request accepted by the configuration manager &ldquo;wins&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fault Detection and Primary Server Immutability</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary server immutability requirement, at any time, server <code>p</code> is only considered the primary server when the configuration manager believes it is in the current configuration. This ensures that in the system, at most only one server in the replica group believes it is the primary server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<p>The configuration manager is responsible for coordinating and maintaining system configuration, ensuring consistency of replica group configuration, version control, and fault recovery. Primary server immutability ensures that there is only one primary server in the system, and multiple servers cannot be primary servers at the same time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="13-coordination-state">1.3 Coordination State</h2>
<h3 id="how-to-ensure-data-consistency-when-primary-server-changes"><strong>How to Ensure Data Consistency When Primary Server Changes</strong></h3>
<p>If the primary server fails, the primary server change process will be triggered, and the replicas become the new primary server. The new primary server needs to complete the coordination process before processing new requests, which is to handle <code>preparedID</code> and <code>committedID</code>.</p>
<h4 id="coordination-process"><strong>Coordination Process</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial State</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A</code> is the primary server, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>D</code> are replicas.</li>
<li><code>committedB</code> is a subset of <code>committedA</code>, and <code>committedA</code> is also a subset of any replica&rsquo;s <code>prepared</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coordination Process</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose a reconfiguration occurs, replacing <code>B</code> as the primary server.</li>
<li>After <code>B</code> completes coordination, the new <code>committedB</code> is the same as the old <code>preparedB</code>, meaning now all replicas&rsquo; <code>prepared</code> and <code>preparedB</code> are aligned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="summary-1"><strong>Summary</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>The new primary will submit all prepared logs now, making <code>preparedIdB</code> and <code>committedIdB</code> the same.</li>
<li>Make all replicas&rsquo; <code>preparedID</code> and the primary&rsquo;s <code>preparedID</code> aligned, extra ones are deleted, and missing ones are added up.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="14-adding-new-replica">1.4 Adding New Replica</h2>
<p>When some replicas in the replica group fail, in order to restore redundancy levels, a new replica can be added to the replica group. When adding a new server to the configuration, the submit invariant must be maintained, and the new replica must have a complete prepare list before joining the replica group, ensuring consistency.</p>
<h3 id="synchronization-scheme">Synchronization Scheme:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simple Synchronization Scheme</strong>
<ul>
<li>Primary server pauses processing new updates until the new replica has copied the prepare list from the existing replicas before continuing work. This ensures consistency but may slow down system processing speed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Candidate Replica Mechanism</strong>
<ul>
<li>Candidate replica: Primary server does not stop processing updates but adds the new replica as a &ldquo;candidate replica&rdquo; to the system. Primary server sends the update prepare message to the candidate replica.</li>
<li>Confirmation mechanism: Candidate replica receives and confirms the message before becoming a member of the system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="configuration-manager-functions">Configuration Manager Functions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Responsible for managing the current configuration of all replica groups in the system, simplifying management.</li>
<li>Separated from data replication protocol, improving system fault tolerance, can tolerate up to <code>n-1</code> replica failures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-pacifica-replication-framework">2. PacificA Replication Framework</h2>
<p>In distributed log-based storage systems, the replication framework is usually used to ensure data persistence and efficient storage, especially when data is distributed across multiple servers. This design provides efficient data management through a combination of log recording, checkpoint, memory cache, and disk image, avoiding frequent random disk writes. The following are the main steps and principles of the design:</p>
<h3 id="1-log-recording-ensure-persistence">1. Log Recording (Ensure Persistence)</h3>
<ul>
<li>When the system receives an update request, it first writes the update to the log. This step ensures that even if the system fails, the log can be used as a persistent backup to recover data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-memory-data-structure-update">2. Memory Data Structure Update</h3>
<ul>
<li>After recording to the log, the system applies the update to the data structure in memory for quick processing and query of the latest data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-regular-checkpoint-creation">3. Regular Checkpoint Creation</h3>
<ul>
<li>To prevent memory overflow, the system periodically creates a checkpoint on the disk to save the data snapshot in memory. This step writes all data in memory to disk to form a persistent checkpoint.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-log-truncation">4. Log Truncation</h3>
<ul>
<li>After creating a checkpoint, the updates recorded in the log that are included in the checkpoint can be truncated or deleted, because they are already safely stored on disk. This step optimizes log storage requirements, preventing log from growing indefinitely.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-query-processing">5. Query Processing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Query is completed through a combination of data structure in memory, checkpoint, and disk image. This allows data to be preferentially obtained from memory, and if data is not in memory, further search is performed on checkpoint and final disk image.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-advantages">Design Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sequential Writing</strong>: The design converts updates to sequential writing based on log, avoiding random disk writes, greatly improving write speed and system performance.</li>
<li><strong>Quick Recovery</strong>: The system can quickly replay log and checkpoint after failure, recovering data.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Optimization</strong>: Log truncation prevents log file from growing indefinitely, ensuring efficient persistence storage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="logical-replication">Logical Replication</h2>
<p>Logical replication is a data replication method used to implement data consistency in distributed systems. It emphasizes maintaining data state consistency across all replicas logically, that is, each replica&rsquo;s state logically should be consistent with the primary replica, although the physical storage methods of the replicas can be different. The following is the specific content explanation:</p>
<h3 id="1-state-consistency">1. State Consistency</h3>
<ul>
<li>In logical replication, all replicas maintain the same state logically and can handle the same type of updates and queries. Each replica can decide when to perform checkpoint (save snapshot) or merge on its own, but their states are logically consistent.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-prepared-list-and-application-log">2. Prepared List and Application Log</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prepared List</strong>: Used to store those updates that have been received but not yet officially submitted. These requests are already prepared but may not have been applied to the primary storage state.</li>
<li><strong>Application Log</strong>: Used to store the log records of all client requests received, including both committed and uncommitted requests. For avoiding write overhead, these two lists can be merged, and only prepared updates need to be saved in the application log.</li>
<li><strong>Log Entry</strong> Contains three key fields: configuration version number, sequence number, and the final committed sequence number. These information help the system track request status, especially ensuring log uniqueness and consistency when the primary node changes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-two-phase-process">3. Two-Phase Process</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Phase</strong>: When a replica receives a request message (including request content, version number, sequence number, etc.), the message is appended to the replica&rsquo;s application log.</li>
<li><strong>Second Phase</strong>: When a request is officially submitted, it is directly applied to memory without needing to be written back to log, because it has been recorded in the log.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-log-truncation-1">4. Log Truncation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The committed updates in the log are truncated after generating checkpoint, only the uncommitted updates are retained. This reduces log file size while retaining the content needed for system failure recovery.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-checkpoint-and-recovery">5. Checkpoint and Recovery</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each checkpoint saves all updates within a certain sequence number range, helping replicas recover after failure.</li>
<li>The replica&rsquo;s disk image (persistent storage) is associated with its last sequence number, which can serve as a recovery point when the replica restarts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="logical-replication-variant-logical-v">Logical Replication Variant (Logical-V)</h2>
<p>A special variant of logical replication is <strong>Logical-V</strong>, which optimizes system performance by reducing resource consumption:</p>
<h3 id="1-only-primary-node-processes-updates">1. Only Primary Node Processes Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>In Logical-V, only the primary node executes state updates, generates checkpoints, and performs merge operations.</li>
<li>Secondary nodes only record update logs without actually applying updates, reducing memory and CPU usage of secondary nodes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-secondary-node-checkpoint-transfer">2. Secondary Node Checkpoint Transfer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Secondary nodes don&rsquo;t generate checkpoints themselves but directly receive completed checkpoints from the primary node.</li>
<li>This approach reduces memory and CPU overhead for replicas but increases network load as checkpoints need to be transferred over the network.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-impact-on-failover">3. Impact on Failover</h3>
<ul>
<li>In Logical-V, if the primary node fails, secondary nodes need to replay logs to recover to the latest state before generating checkpoints.</li>
<li>This results in longer failover times in Logical-V.</li>
</ul>
